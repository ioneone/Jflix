Jflix allows you to check out what TV series or movies Junhong like. I developed this project so that whenever people ask me what I do on my free time, I can tell them I love watching movies and TV series and show them this website. This project is also a byproduct of my GraphQL tutorial series. You can check out these tutorials to see how Jflix was developed in depth.
